- [how much did you actually make me feel better](#how-much-did-this-help)

## What You Did
- First of all, just really being there for me is a big one
- Every time you actually notice me and ask "are you okay?" (I never am when you ask but it still helps)
- You don't ignore me when I talk (this makes me feel so, so, so much better about myself. If you can't tell, it happened a lot before I came here)
