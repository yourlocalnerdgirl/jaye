# Thank You!

- [what you did for me](#what-you-did)
- [why im even doing this](#why-i-am-doing-this)
- [how much did you actually make me feel better](#how-much-did-you-help-me?)

## What You Did
- First of all, just really being there for me is a big one
- Every time you actually notice me and ask "are you okay?" (I never am when you ask but it still helps)
- You don't ignore me when I talk (this makes me feel so, so, so much better about myself. If you can't tell, it happened a lot before I came here)
- You actually care for me (or don't, I can't really tell)
- You try to get me to eat (idk how I'm not dead)

## Why I am doing this
1. Valentines Day
2. I really feel like I'm not enough so there's that
3. Proof that I have way too much time in school
4. I was bored...

## How much did you help me?
  quite a lot actually, for once in my life, I've never felt this good, I feel unstoppable, I've never felt true happiness since I was nine, but now I've felt it so much to the point where it's overwhelming to the point where I cry myself to sleep (but like in a good way idk?). But you really **do** mean a *lot* to me, and to be honest, I don't see this relationship getting to the point of marriage, but there's definitely potential and I don't doubt that it totally get that far... anyway, that's my little tid-bit.
