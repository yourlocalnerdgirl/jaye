## What You Did
- First of all, just really being there for me is a big one
- Every time you actually notice me and ask "are you okay?" (I never am when you ask but it still helps)
- You don't ignore me when I talk (this makes me feel so, so, so much better about myself. If you can't tell, it happened a lot before I came here)
- You actually care for me (or don't, I can't really tell)
- You try to get me to eat (idk how I'm not dead)

## Why I am doing this
1. Valentines Day
2. I really feel like I'm not enough so there's that
3. Proof that I have way too much time in school
4. I was bored...

## How much did you help me?
Quite a lot actually, for once in my life, I've never felt this good, I feel unstoppable, I've never felt true happiness since I was nine, but now I've felt it so much to the point where it's overwhelming to the point where I cry myself to sleep (but like in a good way idk?). But you really **do** mean a *lot* to me, and to be honest, I don't see this relationship getting to the point of marriage, but there's definitely potential and I don't doubt that it totally get that far... anyway, that's my little tid-bit... nevermind I'm writing more, I really do think that you could pick me up out of this hole of depression I'm in, to the point where I can actually smile and laugh without faking it.

About what I said earlier though (at this point this paragraph could be triggering but i doubt it for you) I'm used to being ignored my whole life, I first started cutting when I was eight, drinking when i was nine then getting high at ten, overall it really has been quite a journey, it went up and down, and at my lowest I stole a gun and tried to shoot myself, but ever since then (03/12/24) I've been making a slow, bumpy recovery, but I've made it this far, so why quit now?

anyway thats my yap session␠␠
